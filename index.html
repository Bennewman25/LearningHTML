       Good Day to you. I would like to offer you the opportunity to buy the greatest collection of paintings by the famous
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=Harold+Screstonplatz" tabindex="_blank">Harold Screstonplatz</a>.
       The collection is from his famous <i>Cheese Burglers of Bavaria</i> works.
   </p>
    
    <p>
        These were Painted during the Great Cheese Heists -
        a series of burglaries carried out on Scrumbles the Otter Cheese Mine run entirely by one otter named Scrumbles who is only the 5th otter to own a
        cheese factory in the last decade.
